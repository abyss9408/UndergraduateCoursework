# About Me

Hi there! I'm a student passionate about gaming and exploring the world. When I'm not studying, you'll find me diving into intense gaming sessions or planning my next travel adventure. I'm particularly excited about diving deeper into virtual reality technology this semester and understanding what makes these immersive experiences possible.

## My Hobbies

### Gaming
I enjoy playing computer games, especially **Helldivers 2**. There's something incredibly satisfying about cooperative gameplay and the strategic challenges it brings. Gaming has always been a great way for me to unwind and connect with friends.

### Travelling
Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures is one of my greatest passions. Whether it's discovering hidden gems in a new city or hiking through scenic landscapes, travelling always broadens my perspective and creates lasting memories.

## What I Hope to Learn

### Understanding VR Technology
From this module, I want to become familiar with the technology behind virtual reality. I'm curious about:
- How VR headsets track movement and create immersive environments
- The software and hardware components that power VR experiences
- The potential applications of VR beyond gaming

### Practical Skills
I'm looking forward to gaining hands-on experience with VR development and understanding how these technologies can be applied in real-world scenarios.
