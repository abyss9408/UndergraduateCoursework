Most of the sorting algorithms have a O(n^2) complexity. The best algorithm has achieved
a O(nlgn) complexity. It is shown that sorting algorithm can never be better than O(nlgn). 
Research and discuss this statement in detail. Proof that this statement is true and
under what condition this is true.

Despite the claim, we do have sorting algorithms which can achieve a better complexity
than O(nlgn) as shown below via copilot. Implement one of these algorithms with test
data to illustrate how the algorithm works and proof that it is better than O(nlgn).

nCr = n!/(n-r)!

This statement is true if the algorithm uses comparison-based sorting where the relative order of the elements is only known through the evaluation of ai < aj. Suppose an unsorted array of n elements, the number of permutations in random order that the array can be represented is n!. Each comparison operation evaluates the pairwise ordering and is asymptotically O(1). To evaluate the entire sample space of orderings which is n!, the minimum number of comparison represented by the variable c needed would be 2^c >= n!. by taking the log base 2, the expression evaluates to c >= log2(n!). Using stirling approximation, n! = n^n, c >= nlog2(n). Thus, the worst case performance requires a comparison complexity of at least nlog2(n).
